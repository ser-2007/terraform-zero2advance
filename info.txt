Here is the solution:


It appears that the error is indicating that I ve tried to install Terraform under Rosetta 2 in an ARM default prefix, but Homebrew is already installed in an ARM default prefix, and it's suggesting me either install under x86_64 or ARM.

Let's try a different approach. If I already have Homebrew installed, I might want to uninstall it and then reinstall it in a way that works with Rosetta 2. Here are the steps:

Uninstall Homebrew:


/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/uninstall.sh)"
Reinstall Homebrew using Rosetta 2:


arch -x86_64 /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
Install Terraform using Homebrew:


arch -x86_64 brew install terraform
This should reinstall Homebrew in Rosetta 2 mode and then install Terraform for the x86_64 architecture.

If you encounter any further issues or errors, please provide the specific error messages so that I can assist you more effectively.
